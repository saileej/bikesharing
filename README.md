# Bikesharing

**OVERVIEW**
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the trends observed in New Yorkers' use of Citibikes in order to determine how best to bring Citibikes to Des Moines.  Trends in usage by weekday, gender, and trip duration were analyzed.


**RESULTS**
A dashboard of general information about Citibike trends in NYC is shown below:

Overall, it appears that a majority of Citibike users in NYC are non-members, and that most are male.  In addition, there is a negative correlation between age and average trip duration.  In other words, the younger a Citibike user is, the longer their trip more likely is.


In addition, the graph below depicts the popularity of different lengths of trip duration.  It appears that trips from 3-8 hours are the most common.

The next graph depicts a similar metric filtered by gender.  The graph confirms that roughly 3x as many men in NYC ride Citibikes as women do.

The next image is a heatmap showing the most popular times for checking out Citibikes in NYC.  The highest concentration of trips are taken around 8:00 am and from 5:00 - 6:00 pm on weekdays.

Next, the heatmap was filtered by gender.  It appears that the most common times seen before are more strongly associated with men.  Interestingly, people who did not report their gender tended to use Citibikes consistently throughout the day - in other words, there were no clear patterns observed in their riding habits.

Lastly, the graph below breaks down Citibike riders by gender and user type (subscriber vs. nonsubscriber).  Overall, more subscribers use the Citibike than nonsubscribers.  In particular, male susbcribers use Citibikes more than any other cohort.  The highest proportion of riders is male subscribers on Thursdays.

**SUMMARY**
Overall, it appears that many NYC Citibike riders use the bikes to commute to/from work.  In particular, most riders are men and subscribe to the bikes.  The most common time to rent a bike is between 5 and 8 hours.  From the August data, we can deduce that the fewest amount of rides occur from 1:00 - 5:00 am.  This would likely be the best time to repair the bikes.

When expanding to Des Moines, an emphasis should be placed on how convenient Citibikes are for commuting to work (since a large portion of NYC riders are clearly commuting to work).  In addition, the starting and stopping point maps show that a large number of Citibikes are picked up and returned to a small number of places.  When expanding to Des Moines, a small number of strategic points should be chosen to concentrate more bikes there.

Two additional helpful visualizations would be distance traveled and monitoring the number and time of rides taken throughout the year (rather than only in August).
